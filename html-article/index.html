            President Dallin H. Oaks Shares Four Ways to Come Closer to Jesus Christ
        </h1>
        <h4>In a BYU devotional, the prophet encourages faith, humility, seeking trusted help, and patience amid spiritual challenges</h4>
        <p>In a speech at Brigham Young University (BYU) — his first public address as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/people/dallin-h-oaks/life-leadership?lang=eng" target="_blank">Dallin H. Oaks</a> shared four ways to come closer to Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>At the weekly campus devotional address on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, President Oaks first emphasized a well-known admonition that his predecessor, President Russell M. Nelson, shared in April 2018.</p>

        <p>“In coming days,” <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng" target="_blank">President Nelson said</a>, “it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
        <p>“I feel to emphasize [this] warning,” President Oaks said. “You live in a season where the adversary has become so effective at disguising truth that if you don’t have the Holy Ghost, you will be deceived. Many obstacles lie ahead. The distractions will be many. Even active members may sometimes have concerns about some historical, doctrinal, or social issues connected with the Church.”</p>

        <h5>Students line up outside the Marriott Center in Provo, Utah, on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, to hear from President Dallin H. Oaks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</h5>
        <p>To help all Latter-day Saints “overcome present or future doubts,” President Oaks, the prophet and former BYU president (1971–1980), pointed to four simple actions that can help them come closer to the Savior.</p>
        <ol>
                <li>Strengthen our faith in Him.</li>
                <li>Increase our humility</li>
                <li>Seek help from others.</li>
                <li>Be patient.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>“Whatever those doubts, the way to overcome them is to get closer to our Savior Jesus Christ. Again and again, He has taught us that He is the way,” President Oaks said.</p>
             <p><b>Strengthen Our Faith</b></p>
             <p>President Oaks encouraged Latter-day Saints to develop faith in God and in the mission of His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
             <p>“Strong faith requires more than strong desire,” he said. “It means daily trying, one step at a time, with prayer and scripture study. We can increase our commitment to the principles in the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/articles-of-faith#:~:text=We%C2%A0believe%C2%A0in%C2%A0God%2C%20the%20Eternal%20Father%2C%20and%20in%20His%C2%A0Son%2C%20Jesus%20Christ%2C%20and%20in%20the%C2%A0Holy%20Ghost."target="_blank">First Article of Faith</a>.”</p>
             <p>The prophet added that “these principles anchor our faith in God and will keep us anchored to gospel truth and to our Savior’s example of service to our fellowmen.”</p>

             <p><b>Increase Our Humility</b></p>
             <p>Humility is key, President Oaks taught, because “when we are humble we can more clearly hear the Lord’s voice.” He also said, “look to the needs of others and humility follows.”</p>
             <p>Noting past teachings from Presidents Ezra Taft Benson and Spencer W. Kimball, President Oaks spoke of the importance of being teachable and submitting to God’s will.</p>
